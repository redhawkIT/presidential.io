# Presidential.IO - The Executive Tracker
## WINFO Hackathon 2017 Project

I've made some boilerplate for this project that leverages the following core technologies:
- Webpack for Build Config
- Yarn for package management (better than NPM)
- Standard.JS for linting (it's fast, frills free and eliminates bikeshedding)
My personal boilerplate uses Material-UI. If you want something else, let me know.
To start:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Use `yarn add` for adding additional packages.
4. You can start the development server by running `yarn start`; it will be accessible at http://localhost:8080
5. I've purchased the domain Presidential.IO for this project.
